# Internsavy_T2

This is the second task (out of 3) from the [Internsavy](http://www.internsavy.com).<br /> Where I have wrote script (automised script) that clusters from the given dataset the  data into clusters and visualises it <br />

[K-means](https://medium.com/datadenys/what-is-kmeans-and-how-to-cluster-using-python-scikit-learn-99e132b82ea3) technique was used for clustering. I have wrote script that can find the optimum amount of clusters, so script can identify by itself how will it work and to prove it there will be demonstated 4 graphs for the whole time.
